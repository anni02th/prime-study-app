## Infrastructure Architecture

The Prime Study Abroad application follows a modern cloud-based architecture:

1. **Frontend Hosting**:

1. Deployed on Netlify
2. Connected to GitHub repository for CI/CD
3. Configured with environment variables for API endpoints



2. **Backend Hosting**:

1. Deployed on Render
2. Automatically builds and deploys from GitHub repository
3. Configured with environment variables for database connection, AWS credentials, etc.



3. **Database**:

1. MongoDB Atlas cluster
2. Configured with network access rules for security
3. Connected to backend via connection string



4. **File Storage**:

1. AWS S3 bucket for document storage
2. IAM user with limited permissions for security
3. Connected to backend via AWS SDK



5. **Domain & DNS**:

1. Custom domain configured in Netlify
2. API subdomain configured in Render
3. HTTPS enabled for all endpoints





## Scalability Considerations

The application architecture supports horizontal scaling through:

1. **Stateless Backend**: The Express.js backend is designed to be stateless, allowing multiple instances to run simultaneously
2. **Cloud Database**: MongoDB Atlas can scale as needed to handle increased data volume
3. **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 provides virtually unlimited storage capacity for documents
4. **CDN Integration**: Netlify's built-in CDN ensures fast content delivery worldwide


## Security Implementation

The application implements several security measures:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with token expiration
2. **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing for secure password storage
3. **HTTPS**: All communication encrypted in transit
4. **CORS**: API configured to accept requests only from trusted origins
5. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all user inputs
6. **File Validation**: Type and size checking for uploaded files
7. **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for students, advisors, and administrators
